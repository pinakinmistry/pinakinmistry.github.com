					<h3>About Me:</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
Hi there, I am Pinakin Mistry. I feel great to be part of this very happening AppDev University where we are getting chance to become 
<b>Full Stack Developer</b>. I am certified Java Programmer and Web Component Developer and aim at becoming Enterprise Architect.
I feel joining this university is a great start in this direction.

					<h3>Awesome Concidence:</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>	
					<p>
Since this awesome coincidence is not present in <b>Guinness World Record</b>, you are here in 'About Me' page to read it.
My wife and I have exactly <b>same date of birth, same place of birth, same last name and same first letter in our name</b>.
Isn't it an awesome coincidence? I said it already. Please don't think we are twin because	that's not true. Here is a proof.
Check our middle initials.

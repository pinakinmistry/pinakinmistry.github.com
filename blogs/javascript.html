					<h2>Why JavaScript</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
When Alex mentioned that use of JavaScript is growing, gaining more popularity and will be key skill for a UI developer for at least 
couple of decades, it amplified the interest I have in it. Since I was new to this scripting language, I started from why JavaScript 
exists.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why JavaScript exists:</h3>
					<p>
JavaScript exists to bring life to web pages on client side when they are not talking to server. JavaScript as a programming language 
adds logic or processing within web pages that doesn't need server to get involved in. And this is something that HTML cannot do as it 
just deals with page content due to its markup nature.
<br><br>
JavaScript can be used for input validation, page load/unload time settings, responding to various user events , advertising, cookie 
based functions and many more. Thus, it exists to do things that are possible without involving server, saving page refreshing time, 
making pages as fast as a non web based application.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Once you are impressed with JavaScript, you should fall in love with it for below mentioned advantages:</h3>
					<p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is easy to learn based on the fact that it is similar to other languages like C and java.</li>
	<li>It executes on client side making web pages deal some work load on its own, reducing trips to server.</li>
	<li>It adds functionality to web pages.</li>
	<li>It is more versatile than PHP and SSI scripts as it can be inserted into any web page regardless of the file extension.</li>
	<li>It can also be used inside scripts written in other languages such as Perl and PHP.</li>
</ul>
